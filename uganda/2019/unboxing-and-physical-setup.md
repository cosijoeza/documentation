## Raspberry Pi
### Unboxing and Physical Setup
These instructions describe how to unbox and setup the CanaKit Raspberry Pi, without software installation. The goal is to get each kit setup and packaged into a zip-lock bag for compact transportation to Uganda.  All kits are unboxed and ready for transportation, go to [Operating System Setup](operating-system-setup-raspbian.md) next.

**Kit:** [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (B Plus) Starter Kit (32 GB EVO+ Edition, Premium Black Case)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BCC8PK7)

_Bonus_
Make some KoC/Mwebaza sticker(s) to go on the outside of each RPi case!
