# Create Custom USB Installer

After all customizations are complete, you may now write the new image out to USB key. The new image file will 
require a USB flash drive that is 16GB or larger to proceed. 
 
## Prepare USB Key 

Format the 16GB+ USB key with the default Ubermix 2.2L image (approximately 3.1GB). Instructions are here: 
http://ubermix.org/download.html 
 
At this point, the installer partition has less than 1GB of free space. Because our installation image is much larger, 
we must resize the partition. Working on a Linux laptop (I used Fedora 21), do the following: 

* Insert the USB key 
* Copy all files from the USB to a folder in your desktop 
  * This includes files like: 
     * 2015.03.24_trusty.2.2L.bld 
     * base_image.gz.aa (2.3GB) 
     * blockcount.dat 
     * ... 
* Open a terminal and type: 
  * sudo gparted 
* Choose the correct disk (probably /dev/sdb) 
* Right click the partition and choose Unmount 
* Right click the partition and choose Delete 
* Create a new partition: 
  * fat32 
  * size: 12GB 
  * label: UBERMIX 
* Click the green checkbox to execute the changes 
* Eject the USB, then re-insert 
* Copy the ubermix file from your desktop back onto the USB
